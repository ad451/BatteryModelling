## Overview

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates battery modeling using the SPMT (Single Particle Model with Thermal effects) approach. The notebook focuses on the following aspects:

- Calculating the Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) using the SPMT model.
- Obtaining experimental OCV vs. State of Charge (SOC) data from the Marquis2019 dataset in PyBaMM.
- Simulating battery discharge under various conditions, including constant C-rates (0.1 to 10) and time-varying current profiles (e.g., sinusoidal).
- Calculating errors between the SPMT-modeled OCV and experimental OCV.
- Developing a simple neural network-based residual model to predict errors and improve OCV estimation.
- Evaluating model performance using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Relative Error Ratio (RER).

## Notebook Usage

1. **Data Preparation**: The notebook provides step-by-step instructions on loading and preprocessing experimental OCV vs. SOC data.

2. **Constant C-rate Modeling**:
   - Run the relevant cells to train the SPMT model for constant C-rates and calculate errors.
   - Evaluate model performance using RMSE and RER.

3. **Time-Varying Current Modeling**:
   - Simulate battery discharge using time-varying current profiles, e.g., sin(2Ï€t/60).
   - Calculate errors for the SPMT model.
   - Observe how varying current affects model performance.
